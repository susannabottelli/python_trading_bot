# python_trading_bot
Python program to automise online trading.


# PROJECT DIARY
This porgram was developed in Python using QuantConnect. The aim is to create a fully independent bot that learns patterns from Stock Market charts and autonomously finds the best time to buy and sell on a daily basis.


## PROGRESS TRACKING:
* **8th June 2022 - First prototype**
The program is not complete and the algorithm is not performing well yet. So far, the bot works according to its programmed paths. Machine learning algorithms are yet to be implemented.
